## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Functions
- CSS Variables

### What I learned

I was using this as a chance to practice css functions like clamp to make the site as responsive as possible. I was also using variables for the colors to get used to using these more. I am still working on creating the best layout, this design was quite simple and didnt need much. There were a few instances I used flex box to create an inline row but these were relatively simple. 
I did struggle with the main image overlay but managed to come up with a solution that worked eventually.
